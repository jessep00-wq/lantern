/**
 * The tools that make this assistant yours rather than a generic one.
 *
 * The Agent SDK already brings file reading, editing, globbing, grep and bash.
 * What it does not know is that a particular folder on this machine is a second
 * brain with structure worth respecting. These in-process MCP tools teach it:
 * search the vault semantically, read a note, remember something permanently,
 * log to today's daily note, and look at the screen.
 *
 * They run in the Electron main process, so there is no server to start and no
 * port to secure.
